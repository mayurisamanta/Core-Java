a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why?
interface A{
	int i = 111;
}

class B implements A{
	void methodB(){
		i = 222;
	}
}

Ans : While using interface the implementation class will have all the variables and methods from 
the interface class. In this code we are trying to assign the value of i inside B class, which is 
implementation class of A. int i is already present in class A which by default will be static and
final variable because it is interface. So we can't re-assign the value of final variable in any
of the implementation class.
